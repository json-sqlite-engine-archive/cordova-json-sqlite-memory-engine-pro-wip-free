## About

Android-xxx NDK lib build provides:
- single `XXX` class with native Java interface to the needed C functions
- automatic build for major Android targets (`armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, `x86_64`, `arm64-v8a`) that is accessible from the native Java interface, ~~with the following user defined functions~~:
  - ~~`REGEXP` integrated from [brodybits / sqlite3-regexp-cached](https://github.com/brodybits/sqlite3-regexp-cached) (based on <http://git.altlinux.org/people/at/packages/?p=sqlite3-pcre.git> by Alexey Tourbin, public domain)~~
  - ~~`BASE64` integrated from [brodybits / sqlite3-base64](https://github.com/brodybits/sqlite3-base64), using [brodybits / libb64-encode](https://github.com/brodybits/libb64-encode) (based on <http://libb64.sourceforge.net/> by Chris Venter, public domain)~~

This is accomplished by using [GlueGen](http://jogamp.org/gluegen/www/) around the C module.

**NOTE:** This project references multiple subprojects, which may be resolved by: $ `make init` (as described below).

**WARNING:** The reference handles that are returned by the XXX library functions are raw C pointer values (with `0x100000000` added). If someone uses a reference handle that is not valid, or no longer valid with the XXX library the behavior is undefined (may crash, for example). It is NOT recommended to use this API directly unless you really understand how this library works internally.

~~**BUILD NOTICE:** `android-ndk` pre-17 is needed since this project still supports the deprecated `armeabi` target CPU.~~

See the following reference for installing older `android-ndk` cask using Homebrew: <https://www.jverdeyen.be/mac/downgrade-brew-cask-application/>

To install `android-ndk` version `r16b`, for example:

```sh
brew cask install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/4570652dc6a3a8f7fd2be1053dd43547a2c78e26/Casks/android-ndk.rb
```

Note that `homebrew-cask` seems to have dropped maintenance of the `android-ndk` cask: <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/58883>

## Dependencies

- SQLite (<https://sqlite.org/>) - public domain
- [brodybits / sqlite3-regexp-cached](https://github.com/brodybits/sqlite3-regexp-cached) - based on <http://git.altlinux.org/people/at/packages/?p=sqlite3-pcre.git> by Alexey Tourbin, public domain
- [brodybits / sqlite3-base64](https://github.com/brodybits/sqlite3-base64) - Unlicense (public domain) ref: <http://unlicense.org/>

## For future consideration

- Support direct query of BLOB type

__FUTURE TBD/TODO:__

- Automatic AAR build
- Document this project (again, perhaps in a blog post)
- Some more SQLite API functions will be needed to rebuild the native sqlcipher library to replace the native libraries in the [@sqlcipher / android-database-sqlcipher](https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher) ([SQLCipher for Android](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/)) project.

# Building

## Normal build

Initialize with the subproject references:

$ `make init`

Then to build:

$ `make`

## Regenerage Java & C glue code

$ `make regen`
